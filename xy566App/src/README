XYCOM 566 fast analog input card.

The 566 is a 32 (unipolar) or 16 (bipolar) channel AI
card.  It has a single adc with a programmable multiplexer
to control the sampling of all channels.  The user also
has full control of the integrated AM5913 timing chip
which is used to generate the sampling clock.

While the 566 has several operating modes, this
driver uses only continuous sequence mode.  This is the most
flexible mode.
