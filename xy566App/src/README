The 566 is a 32 (unipolar) or 16 (bipolar) channel AI
card.  It has a single adc with a programmable multiplexer
to control the sampling of all channels.  The user also
has full control of the integrated AM5913 timing chip
which is used to generate the sampling clock.

While the 566 has several operating modes, this
driver uses only continuous sequence mode.  This is the most
flexible mode.


= IOC Shell functions =

== Device setup ==

xycom566setup(
      int id,     Arbitrary id for this card
      int cbase,  A16 base address set on switch block S3
      int dbase,  A24 base address set on switch block S2
      int level,  IRQ level set on switch block S1
      int vec,    IRQ vector (usual restrictions)
      int bipol   0 - 32 unipolar, 1 - 16 bi polar
)

xycom566finish()

Call xycom566finish once before iocInit()

== Clock setup ==

Each card can have only one clock setup, which will be one of
the following.

stc566simple(
      int id,     Arbitrary id for this card
      int div,    Divider on 4 MHz reference clock
      int period  sample clock period (.25*div*period)
)

stc566seqmulti(
      int id,      Arbitrary id for this card
      int div,     Divider on 4 MHz reference clock
      int sampper, sample clock period (.25*div*period)
      int seqper   seqence clock period (.25*div*period)
)

== Sample Sequence construction ==

seq566set(
      int id,     Arbitrary id for this card
      int ch,     Channel 0-31 or 0-15 as appropriate
      int nsamp,  Number of samples (>1)
      int ord,    Order to sample in (lowest first) (1-32)
      int prio,   Priority disambiguate channels with the same order
      int stop    if N>0 then sample N will contain a stop (pause) code
)

Example

seq566set(1, 5, 10, 1, 1)
seq566set(1, 6, 10, 2, 1)

Samples channel 6 10 times, then samples channel 7 10 times.

seq566set(1, 5, 10, 1, 1)
seq566set(1, 6, 10, 1, 2)

Samples channels 6 and 7 alternately (ie 6,7,6,7,6,7...) for
a total of 10 samples each.

= Database =

Example databases are generated using the python script dbpp.py.
This proess is controlled by the .mac files.
These can either be copied/modified to change the .db.
